# Chat GPT 3.5 web interface with Voice (tts and dictation)

the code requires two env variables:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - the api key for the chatgpt api
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` - for tts


build and run. expose port `8080`

I'm sorry for all the mistakes and errors. this is an initial release for a project that was built in two hours using GPT-4 and github copilot

It can be deployed to cloud run and use identity-aware proxy to lock access. (I'll probably release those instructions soon)
